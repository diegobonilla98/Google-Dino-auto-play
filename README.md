# Google-Dino-auto-play
Python implementation of a simple pixel read of the screen.

It's a simple 16-line code that reads the open Google-Dino game (when you don't have internet access) and pressed the space key when the correct pixel gets dark.

Uses the PIL and the Keyboard Python libraries.
Has some major bugs like not detecting birds, fake triggerings and sometimes it fails to work. I've implemented the same code using Processing and It works like a charm so I think is the actual Python speed that fails to get the data at time.
